## 🎯 Responsive Design

| Device        | Viewport Width |
|---------------|----------------|
| Desktop       | > 1000px       |
| Tablet        | 768px – 1000px |
| Mobile        | < 768px        |

Responsive behavior is achieved using media queries and flexible layout containers.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- On page load, each `.card` contains an image, title, and subtitle.
- JavaScript dynamically injects a `play` button inside each card.
- Hovering over a card fades in the play button from the bottom-right.
- Clicking toggles a sample audio playback from `/assets/songX.mp3`.

## 🔮 Future Ideas

- [ ] Add real-time search filtering
- [ ] Integrate audio metadata from an API (e.g., Spotify or Deezer)
- [ ] Save favorites or playlists in `localStorage`
- [ ] Dark/light theme switch
- [ ] Convert into a full-stack MERN app 💻
